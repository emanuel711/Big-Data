# Books rating Big data project

Details

In this project, I used big data tools (mainly pyspark) for the ETL process mimicking the Hadoop environment. The idea is to practice and improve my data analysis abilities with big data tools.

Tools

3 tables with book ratings and voters' information as the data

Colab notebook 

Python pyspark

Tableau for visualization
